# Fundamental Knowledge

**Plugins are typically written in TypeScript and utilize the React and React-DOM libraries.** You really don't need to be an expert in any of these in order to make plugins (typescript has a *pretty similar* syntax to hscript, the language used to make fraytools characters) but the more knowledge the better.

Here are a couple resources to learn more:
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [React Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn)
- [React References](https://react.dev/reference/react#)

There are four plugin types natively supported by Fraytools:

**Metadata Plugins** - Add custom buttons and fields to the Properties panel <br/>
**Publish Plugins** - Create your own UI for exporting/publishing Fraytools projects <br/>
**Types Plugins** - Create custom type definitions <br/>
**Script Asset Plugins** - Add additional pages to the script editor <br/>

# Setting Up

- You will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, basically code editor) to create plugins. I reccommend [Visual Studio Code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install the latest LTS version of [Node.js.](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Download one of my [upgraded example plugins.](https://github.com/awesoee/)

<br/>

### 1. Open Visual Studio Code and click Open Folder.

<br/>

### 2. Find your example plugin and click Select Folder.

If there appears to be vulnerablilities, run the command `npm audit fix`.

<br/>

### 5. Create a build of your plugin by running the command `npm run build`.

If it's successful, you should see something like this, as well as a new folder inside `dist`:

<br/>

### 6. Locate your newly created plugin inside the `dist` folder, and move it to /FraytoolsData/plugins.
The directory should look something like this:

<br/>

### 7. Open Fraytools, then navigate to Plugins > Plugin Manager.

### 8. Enable your new plugin.

Tadaaaa!!! You created your first plugin. You'll see that your plugin has its own config menu in the Plugin Settings section.

It doesn't have any function at its current state. The next page will teach you how to customize and make it look pretty.
